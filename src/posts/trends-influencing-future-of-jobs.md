time travel could be the only way to fully and accurately predict the future. Until then, we will base the predictions on a careful understanding what trends, social and technological processes are currently changing the world around us and shaping our future. Careful analysis and understanding will allow to derive distinct actions and construct possible scenarios.

Let's touch upon the major current trends.
# globalisation and cross-industry capabilities

the global economy is moving toward closer integration and deeper regional specializaiton. Most of the devices are produced from parts developed and sourced from different locations. Therefore the multicultural and multilingual experiences are of big importance now and in the future. Moreover, it is not only necessary to have the ability to communicate in international professional languages, but also to be able to communicate cross-industry around requirements, standards and processes applied.

# digitalisation and disruption

With different explanations out there, digitalisation has been occupying the minds of top managers since years. Even less clarity and probably more fear has been brought by the word disruption. What are they and what how are the jobs affected? Lets pick some key words and go in deep in the next articles. 
Remote employment, distributed teams - and now even more than before - have become a new norm and a challenge but also an opportunity to conservative industries. 
Economic instability, fast technical shifts, lifelong learning, diversity, startups, accelerators, intrapreneurship - all those terms are circulating around and causing question marks in the eyes. 

# from a human as a resource to employee experience (aka EX)

when investors look at the startups raising capital, they look for "team, team, team, market, progress, idea". From a cost centre, human resource is slowly...way too slow...moving towards a key asset. Concepts like employee experience, happiness management, psychological ecosystem of the team, diversity, staffing based on strengths and skills are gaining more visibility and importance, shifting the tasks and routines of human resource departments.

# human centered focus

Products focusing on real needs of the customers or anticipating those. Individualised designs. Vegan. Hand-made. Supporting the right cause. Climate neutral. So many niches in the global landscape, so many new products and services have appeared. Competition gets stronger, speed of technological innovation allow for disruption of value chains and traditional industries. New products and services emerge to replace existing ones or even to wipe out entire markets.

# from job functions to project missions

In the reality of constant change and disruption there are less and less jobs left, where one can just perform the same tasks for the entire lifetime. The majority of new jobs that are appearing require creativity, innovative and bold approaches to mundane tasks. Task execution changes too, the assembly line technique is not always beneficial, there are many frameworks being used like agile, kanban and others that require different team organisation and skills. Ability to work in project teams in different execution framework is essential. More and more in the time of change, humans should prepare to work in conditions of high uncertainty, that require swift decision-making capabilities, reaction to changing environment, resource re-allocation, and strict workflow time-management.

# automated everything

With the significant improvement of automation technologies manual and partially intellectual labour can be replaced or augmented. In the past decade the process had intensified significantly as more and more tasks can be performed without human intervention. Additionally, the cost of creation of industrial and also household robots is getting down, so its becoming available to more companies and general public. According to the estimation of Oxford scientists from Martin Schoolâ€™s Programme on the Impacts of Future Technology, up to 45% of existing jobs in developed countries will be replaced by robots and computer software within the next 20 years. However, this does not mean that the unemployment rate should increase drastically. There will be even more jobs that will appear, especially the ones connected with future skills like creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, complex problem solving, storytelling. Therefore, artistic talent, which have always been a prerogative of solitary creators, will become a mass phenomenon. Jobs will also involve team work, therefore the ability to organize joint work with other individuals and groups will become a very common and important skill.

# internet of everything

Technological capabilities allow seamless inter-connectedness of different devices and systems. Devices are becoming smarter and move autonomous, enhancing humans in the Human + Machine symbiosis. Clearly, we will need more skills that enable us to use that technical opportunity to our advantage, learn, how to interact with the machines and develop them further. Current computer skills are still essential but definitely not enough to operate complex systems. Soon basic development skills will be a necessary requirement. 

# leadership challenge

The professional world of the future is sophisticated, flexibly utilizing technological solutions and innovations and where the only constant is change. Not only is it extremely important to be able to find one's way within this realm but also lead others, motivate, inspire. Leaders still have to manage projects, teams, and entire organizations. What kind of skills should be obtained in order to successfully cope with new challenges and grasp the opportunities? How can innovation environment be created and maintained? One example is systems thinking - to come to the essence of the problem catching up with unfamiliar business area, ability to quickly understand the intricacies of complicated processes, organizations or mechanisms, ability to rely on technologies, data, artificial intelligence. Systems thinking is therefore one of the key capabilities of the future leader.
